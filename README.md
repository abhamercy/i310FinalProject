# Road Safety in Austin: A ML Approach

Project Title: Evaluating Austin Road Safety Through Basic Techniques & Clustering Unsupervised ML Methods

This project analyzes real-time traffic incident data from a CSV file and visualizes the results using Python and various data science libraries.

Installation

To set up the required libraries for this project, use the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn folium

Usage

The project is structured into several steps:

Import the required libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
Load the dataset from the CSV file.
Wrangle and clean the data, including converting date columns to datetime objects, latitude and longitude columns to floats, and removing rows with missing values.
Analyze the data and create visualizations, such as:
Basic statistics of the dataset
Count and visualization of reported issues
Analyzing incidents by time
Analyzing the spatial distribution of incidents using KMeans clustering
Clustering incidents by hour of the day
